I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes; my interest involves solving rubik's cubes of different dimensions (3x3, 4x4, and triangles, etc) and discovering different algorithms. The internet is full of different solutions; however, it is it is rarely every described how these solutions were discovered. In this post, I'll try to detail how one can solve the rubik's cube from scratch.

Keep in mind, the solution presented in this post is by no mean the fastest. It takes a very long time to solve a Rubik's Cube using this algorithm.
